        Hello guys welcome to the popular estate#ankush estate. I am here to talk about what we do and the meaning of real estate. First, we are one of the most popular real estate companies in the world. We manage to sell around 8 to 9 16 million dollar houses and year. We have won many plaques and rewards and even have our business. Now I am going to talk a little bit about myself. I am 12 years old and I have built this website for my parents. As you see on the real estate page there are many
        houses that we have sold in the past. So if you are looking for an awesome house for a good house you know who to call.
        Also, we give special discounts to people who subscribe to my YouTube channel. Also, there are a couple of more things you should know about. We have a business membership. If you close on a house which is worth more than 5 million dollars you will get a special all-inclusive vacation to your dream place. So if you are interested in buying a house and applying for a business membership before that we know that you are interested in buying a house for over 5 million dollars. Now there are two more things you need to know about this business. We have worked with many celebrities and found them many homes. Here are some people whom we have worked with: The Flash, Captain Underpants, spider man, Elon Musk and Tony Stark. This shows that we are one of the best real estate businesses here. And one last thing. I did not mention this earlier but we have two business numbers our second one is 469-369-9869
